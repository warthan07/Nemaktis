Overview
========

Nemaktis is an open-source platform including tools for propagating and visualising optical
field in complex birefringent media such as liquid crystal (LC) layers. It includes three
backends implementing advanced numerical methods for light propagation, as well as an
easy-to-use high level interface in python allowing to quickly setup a simulation and visualize
optical micrographs of a LC structure as in a real microscope.
